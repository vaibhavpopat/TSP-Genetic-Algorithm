# TSP-Genetic-Algorithm

This repository takes as input a fully connected graph connecting N cities and finds the most optimal path possible to cover all the cities once using Genetic Algorithms technique. It comprises of operations namely Random Selection, Crossover and Mutation with the random parameters fine tuned to get the most optimal results.

Files :
1. TSP_Genetic.py - Reads a fully connected graph as input. Finds the most optimal path connecting all cities once and prints that path on the console.
2. input.txt - Contains number of cities(N) followed by a (N*N) fully connected graph (as matrix) containing distances of cities from one another.
